GameEngine for BeefLang

To try the sample program, open the workspace at `Atma.Framewor\samples` and try the `NeonShooter` project.

This engine is very much work-in-progress and will have continious breaking changes for the time being.


The current plan is to clean up the engine code and provide documentation. This clean up process will reorganize and create breaking changes but the samples should always work.
